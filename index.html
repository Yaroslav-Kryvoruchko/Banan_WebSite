                Green bananas may provide some additional nutrients and benefits
                that yellow bananas do not. They’re rich in resistant starch and
                pectin, which are filling, improve digestive health and help
                lower blood sugar levels. However, some people find that green
                bananas have a bitter taste and bad texture. Interestingly, the
                resistant starch and pectin gradually decrease as the banana
                ripens, so bananas that are yellow with a hint of green should
                still contain small amounts.For this reason, the banana doesn’t
                have to be completely green for you to get at least some of
                these benefits.

                Red bananas are a group of varieties of banana with
                reddish-purple skin. Some are smaller and plumper than the
                common Cavendish banana, others much larger. When ripe, raw red
                bananas have a flesh that is cream to light pink in color. They
                are also softer and sweeter than the yellow Cavendish varieties,
                some with a slight raspberry flavor and others with an earthy
                one. Many red bananas are exported by producers in East Africa,
                Asia, South America and the United Arab Emirates. They are a
                favorite in Central America as a form of aphrodisiac juice,
                along with being a favourite in India in order to promote
                fertility but are sold throughout the world.

                Honey Bananas from Elemental Seeds is a heavy-handed hybrid
                strain bred from Strawberry Banana and Honey Boo Boo. This
                cannabis strain earns its name with a resinous coat as sticky as
                honey and an unmistakable banana aroma. She tends to provide
                weighty full-body effects coupled with an invigorating buzz of
                cerebral euphoria.

              Nendrum banana - also called Kerala here. Large, pointed, yellow. The pulp is
              orange, dense, almost crunchy, with a hard core. Sweet, aromatic,
              with a slight sourness - very tasty! It costs 40 rupees (30
              rubles) per kilogram (7-8 pieces). Unlike other varieties, this
              one is for some reason sold in kilograms, and not in pieces.
              Locals love this variety and believe that it is good for your
              health. Although I doubt the other varieties are not helpful.
